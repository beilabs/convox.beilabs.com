title: Farewell ABC
---

I'm sad to write that this is my last day at ABC.  I started in ABC only last year and while it was only a short time I will look at my time at Aunty fondly.  

I will miss the drive and energy of my team.  They've been firing on all cylinders and running lean from the get go.  Continuous deployments, regular sprints and a drive to be the best in the market.

They also had a blockbuster year at through their ABC shop website, the new upgrades and strategies will pay off for years to come I hope. 

Regular lunch outings with my lunch posse, while it put inches on my waistline it was great to have a regular group to chat to over spicy food.  

Recently my team has been nominated for multiple 2 AIMIA awards and I'm certain that they're will be many more on the horizon. 

Farewell ABC Commercial, I already miss you.
