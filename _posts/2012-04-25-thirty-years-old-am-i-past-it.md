title: 30, am I past it?
---

It's Anzac day.  It's also my birthday, Australia grinds to a halt.

Holy crap, I'm suddenly 30.  Well that came along fast.  

My friends say it's all downhill for me from now.  

Old man, past his prime, time to settle down.

Screw that. 

It's only the beginning...time to play some two-up.
