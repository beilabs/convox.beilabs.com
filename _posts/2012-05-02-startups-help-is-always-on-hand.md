So today Forbes released their list of the top startup incubators that have been runnning in the US.



Topping the list was Y-Combinator having been around for quite some time with an incredible allumni.  Many of the Australian crew seem to focus on 500 startups which was number 8 in the list.

It got me to thinking about the number of incubators/accellerators that have been launched in Australia over the past few years, there seems to be more and more every few months.  Next up we'll be seeing incubators to make incubators, how very meta.
