title: Entrepreneural video roundup - Hack Fwd
---

Since I've moved out of the city I'm getting to a lot less meetups lately.  I have however been loading up a queue of videos to watch lately.  My sister works at [IDEO](http://ideo.com), a fantastic design company and a number of years ago she turned me on to [Hack Fwd](http://hackfwd.com). Here are some of the gems that have been coming out of there.
