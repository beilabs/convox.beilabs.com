title: Fuck you cancer!
---

My dad was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer.  

Treatment has been stopped, it has done no good.  In fact, it has actually cause more harm.

I'm feeling completely helpless right now, not able to do a single thing to prevent this.  What's the point in being an identical match in everyway if I can't do anything!

Fuck you cancer, this shouldn't be happening.  It's just not right!
