<p>Another interesting article from Michael Arrington today. <a href='http://uncrunched.com/2011/11/27/startups-are-hard-so-work-more-cry-less-and-quit-all-the-whining/'>Startups are hard. So work more, cry less, and quit all the whining</a>.</p>

<p>The article gave a number of examples of people talking about how hard they work. It&#8217;s something that everyone does, they work hard, they tell people about it. Woe is my life.</p>

<p>At the end of the article he writes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Work hard. Cry less. And realize youâ€™re part of history.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What a great phrase for any startup entrepreneur.</p>

<p>Startups are tough, if they weren&#8217;t then everyone would be doing one. Competition couldn&#8217;t be higher, there is always someone ready to copy your latest feature or implement the idea you just had in the shower.</p>

<p>Satisfaction is something that everyone craves in their profession. Depression is something that effects everyone at some point in their lives.</p>

<p>Write up a list of things that you want to achieve by the end of the day and do it. If you don&#8217;t get through them all then you need to take a long look at how you are estimating your time. Being a better judge of how long something will take comes with experience, the more you get the easier it becomes.</p>

<p>I often look back at my time in China working for a Chinese software company. 16 hour days were part of the norm. There was such an abundance of talent, naturally once a developer burned out he was replaced with the next person in line, with another 10 people ready to take their place. This was the type of place where even after a 16 hour shift you would be expected to be at your cubicle at 8.30am, checked in the system and ready for the days work. While the pressure was similar to a startup environment it had none of the incentives.</p>

<p>This time last year I admit that I was depressed. I had thrown myself head first into a hobby <a href='http://dealpinch.com'>startup</a> which took up any free time I had on hand. Often coding up ideas till 4 in the morning only to get up for work at 7am the next day. As you can expect, burnout came and it came hard. My relationship with my future wife deteriotated. I&#8217;m glad to say she stuck around and for that I will always be thankful.</p>

<p>These days I work on projects in a much more methodical manner. I question why a certain feature is needed much more often. I take each day as it comes with a goal to be performed every single day. Win small, win often and above all ship regularly. Your health and satisfaction will improve.</p>

<p>While being a part of history is great, make sure that enjoy your life. You only get one.</p>
