<p>So today I got to build a small little application that does the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>It reads a specific email account through the IMAP protocol</li>

<li>Imports the message and all of it&#8217;s attachments</li>

<li>Saves the message to a postgres database</li>

<li>Marks the message as read</li>

<li>Copies the message to the Complete folder</li>

<li>Removes the message from the Inbox</li>
</ul>

<p>So why did I do this? Well, I really want a simple way to post messages from my phone to my blog. Gmail currently allows me to work on drafts while on the move and will push when I resume connectivity. Hopefully this will result in a vast increase in the number of posts I make in the future.</p>

<p>All of this was down to the Ruby IMAP library and Mikel Lindsaars awesome Mail library. You can view the source code of this website at <a href='https://github.com/beilabs/www.beilabs.com'>https://github.com/beilabs/www.beilabs.com</a> <em>This blog is now replaced with a simplified Jekyll blog framework.</em></p>

<p>There are still a number of things to do such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Read and process attachments</li>

<li>Save to Amazon S3</li>
</ul>
