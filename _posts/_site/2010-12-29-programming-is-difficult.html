<p>Mastering programming takes an enormous amount of time. Like any discipline it requires dedication and hard work to become well regarded in the field.</p>

<p>Learn something new today, repeat what you learned and repeat it again. Chances are that the next time you do it will be significantly faster than the first time.</p>

<p>Always be willing to try new languages and approaches, it will serve you well. Banging your head off a wall for hours just to get it to finally do what you want is the reward that all developers crave.</p>

<p>Programming is difficult, depending on what you want to accomplish, but the rewards are so satisfying that I can&#8217;t see myself in any other profession.</p>
