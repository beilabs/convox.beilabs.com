title: My daily commute - A train ride
---

An hour and a half to get there. Often two hours to get home. Frodo never took this long to drop off that ring of his.

That's three hours every day.  Three hours on my self medicated coffee high to hack on my own code. Florence and the Crows blaring in my ear, sheeple glaring at the ferociousness of my typing, fingers contorted to the weirdest angles in an effort to reach the ultimate emacs key binding. Nirvana for some, hell for many.

Welcome to my office, a place to get shit done. 

A pity when many don't brush their teeth properly or apply deodorant enough.
