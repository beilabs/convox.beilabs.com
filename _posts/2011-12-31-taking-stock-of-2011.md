My nephew Sidney was born!

Proposed to a wonderful woman, she said yes!

Deal Pinch made Techcrunch, CNN, LA Times and many more publications

Application for Australian Permenant Residency is now underway

Launched Australian Art Review

Launched Editorial Management System (major project)

Commenced work on the new Westwick-Farrow CMS

Commenced work on as yet un-named mobile project, stealth baby yeah!

Launched Deal Pinch Mobile

2011 has been a busy year.  2012 will bring a wedding in Kathmandu, a trip to Ireland, Australian residency and hopefully even more startup success.  I'll also get to meet Sidney for the very first time high in the mountains!
