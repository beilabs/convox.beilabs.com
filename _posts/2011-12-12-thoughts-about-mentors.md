So you've got a mentor?  Couple of pointers and tips for you.

You're always going to get conflicting advice / opinions depending on who you speak to.

Despite their best intentions, some mentors can get it wrong. mentors are not always right!

An opinion is just that, an opinion.  It's not fact just because it comes out of a mentors mounth, research everything they say and don't take it as a concrete fact just because they believe it is!

Choose a mentor that you can work with over a long period of time.  They're often like a co-founder, make sure you get along with them because a good one is worth their weight in gold!

Lastly, always know that it's your company! Decide the direction that you want to take it and make sure it is a direction that makes you happy!
