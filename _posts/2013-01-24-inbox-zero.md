title: Inbox Zero
---

One of the tricks I learned today was to turn on keyboard shortcuts for Gmail and auto-advance(labs).  Auto advance automatically moves to the next message on the list after you have archived or deleted or actioned upon a message instead of returning directly to the inbox.  

Once keyboard shortcuts are turned on you can simply use '#' to delete a message and 'e' to archive a message.  Shortcut power for the win. 

My inbox has always been one large list of things to get around to.  Messages were never deleted or archived, they just went further down on the list.  I'll be either archiving or deleting messages as I check on them daily, if there is an action to be made then they will be starred for further use.  

I'm changing the way I work, the way I exercise, what I eat, the way I get to work.  Time to start on how I use my email.
