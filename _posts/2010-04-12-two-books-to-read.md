title: Two books to read
---

Two books I'm really looking forward to reading over the next few weeks:

##The Fortune at the Bottom of the Pyramid: Eradicating Poverty Through Profits
The bottom of the (economic) pyramid consists of the 4 billion people living on less than $2 per day. For more than 50 years, the World Bank, donor nations, various aid agencies, national governments, and, lately, civil society organizations have all done their best, but they were unable to eradicate poverty. Aware of this frustrating fact, C.K. Prahalad begins his book: "The Fortune at the Bottom of the Pyramid" with a simple yet revolutionary proposition: If we stop thinking of the poor as victims or as a burden and start recognizing them as resilient and creative entrepreneurs and value-conscious consumers, a whole new world of opportunity will open up.

##Rework
Expecting a lot from Rework, but I've been a fan of Signals Vs Noise for quite some time so I'm guessing a lot of SvN will be just regurgitated onto a page. "Jason Fried and David Hansson follow their own advice in REWORK, laying bare the surprising philosophies at the core of 37signals' success and inspiring us to put them into practice.

Any other recommendations for me?
