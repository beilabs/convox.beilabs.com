title: My Rasberry PI dashboard project
---

So last month I got around to getting a rasberry pi.  It's a cute little device.  I immediately installed Rasbian as an operating system, updated the core software and then installed chromium.

I wanted this to act as a dashboard hooked up to a monitor in portrait mode.
