##Presentation Overview:
* I was raised to be an entrepreneur

* We miss opportunities to find these kids with entrepreneurial traits

* As kids we have passions (these are crushed early)

* Promote kidspassions

* No-one says "Become an entrepreneur"

* Teach kids to open a business instead of accepting government handouts

* We teach out kids to go after really good jobs

* Media says go for fame (become a model, singer, celebrity)

* MBA programs do not teach kids to be entrepreneurs

* Bipolar disorder is nicknamed the CEO disease

* Entrepreneurs cheat! We don't do accounting, we hire accounting.

* An entrepreneurs definition: "A person who organizes operates and assumes the risk for a business venture"

* Hate the thought of having a job and love the thought of employing people.

* Become an entrepreneur at a young age.

* Buy low, sell hi. Don't sell to the poor people, sell to the rich kids.

* Don't reveal your source

* Manual labor sucks but recurring revenue is great

* Make more money faster (10 dollars for 1 hour is better than 10 dollars for 5 hours)

* Why not give your kids games to teach entrepreneur ship

* Ensure that your kids never waste a penny

* Allowances teach the wrong habbits, entrepreneurs will never get a regular paycheck

* Always negotiate with your kids

* 50% of money goes into a bank account (house account), 50% of money goes to whatever they want (toy account)

* Get your kids a broker

* Don't always read stories to your kids, have them read stories to you (Get them to talk)

* Show kids what a bad employee is like and what a good employee is like (Point out bad / good customer service)

* Do not medicate your kids for ADD unless it is impossible to live with!

##Teach your kids: 
* Problem solving

* To ask questions

* To be creative

* To lead others

* To learn from mistakes

* How to save money

* To want to make Money

* How to sell

* To ask for help

* Public speaking

* To never give up

* To see solutions

* Rank entrepreneurship right up with Law and Medicine!

##My view
Very inspiring stuff, When I do have kids I'll be instilling these values at a very early age. Love the idea of negotiating with my kid, everything is negotiable - it's something they should learn at a very early age.
