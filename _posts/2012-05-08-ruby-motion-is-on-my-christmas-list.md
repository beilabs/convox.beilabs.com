![Welcome to Ruby Motion](http://s3.amazonaws.com/blog.beilabs.com/images/2012-05-08-ruby-motion.png "Welcome to Ruby Motion")

[RubyMotion](http://rubymotion.com/) is a revolutionary toolchain for iOS.  It lets you quickly develop and test native iOS applications for iPhone or iPad, all using the awesome Ruby language you know and love.

* Create a project. 
* Run your app in the simulator. 
* Deploy on your IOS device. 
* Create an App Store package. 
* Navigate and introspect the iOS API
* Behavior-driven development framework
* RubyMotion makes Ruby as fast as Objective-C
* It's Ruby stupid

Seriously, what is not to like about this?  BTW, It was built by the original Mac Ruby author, [Laurent Sansonetti](http://chopine.be/)
