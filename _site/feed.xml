	<title>Thoughts about mentors</title>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;So you've got a mentor?  Couple of pointers and tips for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You're always going to get conflicting advice / opinions depending on who you speak to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite their best intentions, some mentors can get it wrong. mentors are not always right!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An opinion is just that, an opinion.  It's not fact just because it comes out of a mentors mounth, research everything they say and don't take it as a concrete fact just because they believe it is!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Choose a mentor that you can work with over a long period of time.  They're often like a co-founder, make sure you get along with them because a good one is worth their weight in gold!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, always know that it's your company! Decide the direction that you want to take it and make sure it is a direction that makes you happy!&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Ireland means business</title>
	<description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/Gy6e31wI6Qg&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We've come a long way since the last recession. While Ireland does not have the natural resources of countries like Australia or the US, we do have a large, skilled, educated workforce; this is Irelands greatest asset&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've always known that Ireland is an awesome country, now you do too.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Work hard. Cry less. And realize you’re part of history.</title>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Another interesting article from Michael Arrington today.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://uncrunched.com/2011/11/27/startups-are-hard-so-work-more-cry-less-and-quit-all-the-whining/&quot;&gt;Startups are hard. So work more, cry less, and quit all the whining&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article gave a number of examples of people talking about how hard they work.  It's something that everyone does, they work hard, they tell people about it. Woe is my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the article he writes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Work hard. Cry less. And realize you’re part of history.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What a great phrase for any startup entrepreneur.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Startups are tough, if they weren't then everyone would be doing one.  Competition couldn't be higher, there is always someone ready to copy your latest feature or implement the idea you just had in the shower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Satisfaction is something that everyone craves in their profession.  Depression is something that effects everyone at some point in their lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Write up a list of things that you want to achieve by the end of the day and do it.  If you don't get through them all then you need to take a long look at how you are estimating your time.  Being a better judge of how long something will take comes with experience, the more you get the easier it becomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I often look back at my time in China working for a Chinese software company.  16 hour days were part of the norm.  There was such an abundance of talent, naturally once a developer burned out he was replaced with the next person in line, with another 10 people ready to take their place.  This was the type of place where even after a 16 hour shift you would be expected to be at your cubicle at 8.30am, checked in the system and ready for the days work.  While the pressure was similar to a startup environment it had none of the incentives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time last year I admit that I was depressed. I had thrown myself head first into a hobby &lt;a href=&quot;http://dealpinch.com&quot;&gt;startup&lt;/a&gt; which took up any free time I had on hand.  Often coding up ideas till 4 in the morning only to get up for work at 7am the next day.  As you can expect, burnout came and it came hard.  My relationship with my future wife deteriotated.  I'm glad to say she stuck around and for that I will always be thankful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These days I work on projects in a much more methodical manner.  I question why a certain feature is needed much more often.  I take each day as it comes with a goal to be performed every single day.  Win small, win often and above all ship regularly.  Your health and satisfaction will improve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While being a part of history is great, make sure that enjoy your life.  You only get one.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Bootstrap Xtra released</title>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Bootstrap Xtra extends Bootstrap
Bootstrap is a toolkit from Twitter designed to kickstart development of webapps and sites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It includes base CSS and HTML for typography, forms, buttons, tables, grids, navigation, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bootstrap Xtra inludes extra features that are not included in Bootstrap but may be useful for some people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can grab it here: &lt;a href=&quot;http://lightglitch.github.com/bootstrap-xtra/&quot;&gt;http://lightglitch.github.com/bootstrap-xtra/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Get 'er done...</title>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&quot;I had that idea years before they did it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a common statement amongst developers.  The problem is that they either failed to execute or just never acted up on the idea in the first place.  Working alone can be a very daunting task.  A sole developer can cut a very lonely figure and often as a result failed startups are a dime a dozen.  My advice: just fucking do it.  Words to live by though often words words to regret.  Work on your idea one line of code at a time, one meeting at a time, one night at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Missed opportunities happen all the time and will always continue to occur.  Get out and meet like minded people at networking events like Ruby Oceania and Silicon Beach in Sydney.  One of my resolutions this year is to be much more open for opportunities of any description.  Saying yes to new chances, meeting new people and working on new ideas.  Follow up with chance encounters, you never know what path it will lead you down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make 2011 your year to shine because no-one else is ever going to make it for you.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Programming is difficult...</title>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://jamesjohnsona.tumblr.com/post/2088297700/programming-has-been-difficult&quot;&gt;James Johnson&lt;/a&gt; wrote earlier this month that &quot;Programming has been difficult...(But Rewarding).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mastering programming takes an enormous amount of time.  Like any discipline it requires dedication and hard work to become well regarded in the field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learn something new today, repeat what you learned and repeat it again.  Chances are that the next time you do it will be significantly faster than the first time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Always be willing to try new languages and approaches, it will serve you well.  Banging your head off a wall for hours just to get it to finally do what you want is the reward that all developers crave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Programming is difficult, depending on what you want to accomplish, but the rewards are so satisfying that I can't see myself in any other profession.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Messing around with the Ruby IMAP and Mail libraries</title>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;So today I got to build a small little application that does the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;   It reads a specific email account through the IMAP protocol&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;   Imports the message and all of it's attachments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;   Saves the message to a postgres database&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;   Marks the message as read&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;   Copies the message to the Complete folder&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;   Removes the message from the Inbox&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So why did I do this? Well, I really want a simple way to post messages from my phone to my blog.  Gmail currently allows me to work on drafts while on the move and will push when I resume connectivity.  Hopefully this will result in a vast increase in the number of posts I make in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this was down to the Ruby IMAP library and Mikel Lindsaars awesome Mail library.  You can view the source code of this website at &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/beilabs/www.beilabs.com&quot;&gt;https://github.com/beilabs/www.beilabs.com&lt;/a&gt; *This blog is now replaced with a simplified Jekyll blog framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are still a number of things to do such as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;   Read and process attachments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;   Save to Amazon S3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
