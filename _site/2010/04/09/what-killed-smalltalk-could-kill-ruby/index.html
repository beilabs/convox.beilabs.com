<h2>Overview of this presentation</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Smalltalk &amp; Ruby are deeply interrelated.</p></li>
<li><p>Much of the same syntax between the two languages</p></li>
<li><p>From 1970s Smalltalk was the language to watch</p></li>
<li><p>Smalltalk epitomized Object Orientated Design</p></li>
<li><p>Described C++ as a mans language (need balls to code in it and make it work)</p></li>
<li><p>Describes Java as an estrogen type language (presuming he means only women code in it?)</p></li>
<li><p>Smalltalk had a productivity benefit of a factor of 5. Compared to a C application.</p></li>
<li><p>Refactoring in Smalltalk was a breeze</p></li>
<li><p>What killed Smalltalk? ( umm, at this stage I have no idea, he jumps to a new topic)</p></li>
<li><p>Definition of clean code - "when you look at a routine and its pretty much what you expected"</p></li>
<li><p>Best metric for clean code is 0 WTFs per minute</p></li>
<li><p>What killed Smalltalk is that it was just too easy to make a mess (Finally, 20 mins in!) Quote from Ward Cunningham</p></li>
<li><p>So easy to make an indirect and impenetrable system over time</p></li>
<li><p>Companies developing in Smalltalk were screwed up at the time</p></li>
<li><p>You can make a mess in Ruby, simple, elegant, wonderful language; still easy to make a mess</p></li>
<li><p>Projects in Ruby start well, but the framework is often violated over time; making a mess...</p></li>
<li><p>Boyscout rule, leave the campground cleaner than when you entered it. (Actual quote - leave life better than you found it) - apply this to your source code. Would make code get better and better as time goes by. Most of the time, cleaning code is hard!</p></li>
<li><p>Quote of the presentation - "If you touch it, you will break it. If you break it, it becomes yours. The best policy is to walk away, run. the messes are hard to clean"</p></li>
<li><p>Test Driven Development is the solution</p></li>
<li><p>Rails and Ruby is great for Test Driven Development.</p></li>
<li><p>Other languages have TDD, was born in Smalltalk.</p></li>
<li><p>Talks about TDD methods; If you follow TDD, regularly write and run tests, then there is no fear to change code.</p></li>
<li><p>Nothing makes a system more maintainable than a suite of tests</p></li>
<li><p>He loves Rspec and Cucumber (Behaviour Driven Development BDD)</p></li>
<li><p>TDD never really became a part of Smalltalks culture but is integral to the Ruby community</p></li>
<li><p>TDD will keep your code clean</p></li>
<li><p>There was an arrogance to the Smalltalk community ( I sometimes can see this in the Ruby community )</p></li>
<li><p>Our tools are so good, our language is so good we don't need to follow the rules. Smalltalk people didn't want to do regular programming (Enterprise Applications, etc)</p></li>
<li><p>Your language may be powerful, but you must be careful with it. just because we can do a thing, it does not necessarily mean we must do that thing (Star Trek quote) Us vs them feeling in the Smalltalk community.</p></li>
<li><p>Ruby community is not going to go down this path because:</p></li>
<li><p>Discipline - TDD makes you feel good inside</p></li>
<li><p>Professionalism - did the doctor wash their hands, did you write your tests?</p></li>
<li><p>Acceptance - we need to solve the dirty problems ( Need to adapt to the enterprises needs - do not solve only the problems you like.)</p></li>
<li><p>We have a great tool in Ruby, we can kill it, let's not do that!</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>My view</h2>

<p>Great presentation style, he's quite funny. Very inspirational lecturer for developers confirming that TDD/BDD are the ways forward for software engineering.</p>
